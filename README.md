# Translokacijos
The main purpose of this course paper is to learn about tools and programs that are being used in order to analyze molecular data and translocations. The main parts of this course paper were - analyzing the literature, learning about tools and programs, trying to simulate translocations and trying to obtain molecular data in order to do basic data analysis. The tools that were used are - Rcpp program to simulate translocations, Wgsim program, SAMtools and Bowtie2 tool sets and IGV program. 
The molecular data analysis was made using two sets of molecular data. The difference between those sets is that they were made with different error and mutation rates.
Data was analyzed visually and by analyzing SAM files. The research revealed that translocations were found in roughly the exact place in which they were implemented. There were a few main differences between the two data sets. Distinct number of reads that was found in insertion files from foreign chromosome and different quality and accuracy of the data. The main cause of these differences was distinct error and mutation rate. \par 
To continue this kind of research and develop new tools for translocation analysis in the future, it is important to do more experiments with different data sets, to analyze more tools and programs and to make research with real, not simulated data sets.
